"""Request schemas for PixelForge AI tool workflows.

These Pydantic models define the request payloads accepted by the shared AI job
initialization endpoint and each feature-specific start endpoint.

The workflow is split into two phases:
    1. Initialization:
       The client requests a job ID and secure Azure upload URL.
    2. Start:
       The client uploads required files, then asks the backend to queue
       background AI processing.

Only request-shape documentation lives here. Business rules such as quota
checks, queue limits, Turnstile verification, and Azure interaction are handled
by the service layer.
