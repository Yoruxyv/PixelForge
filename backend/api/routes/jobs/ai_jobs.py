"""Shared AI job workflow routes.

This module owns the routes that are common to all AI tools:

    - ``POST /{feature}/init``:
      validates bot protection, checks usage quota, creates a job ID, and
      returns secure Azure upload URL metadata.

    - ``GET /result/{job_id}``:
      polls Azure-backed job state and returns whether the result is still
      processing, ready, or failed.

    - ``GET /usage``:
      returns the current usage status for a feature and client.

    - ``GET /limits``:
      returns public upload/result limits so the frontend can validate using
      backend-owned configuration instead of hardcoded client values.

Feature-specific ``/start`` routes live in ``api.routes.ai_tools`` because
starting a job may require tool-specific arguments such as upscale scale,
object-removal mask filenames, or future tool-specific payloads.
