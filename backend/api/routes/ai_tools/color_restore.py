"""Color restoration start route.

This module exposes the endpoint responsible for starting a previously
initialized color restoration job. The actual AI execution is delegated to
``JobManager`` through the shared job dispatcher so route handlers remain thin
and consistent across AI tools.

Expected workflow:
    1. Client calls ``/{feature}/init`` to create a job and upload URL.
    2. Client uploads the source image to Azure Blob Storage.
    3. Client calls this route with the returned job metadata.
    4. The job is reserved, queued, and processed in the background.
