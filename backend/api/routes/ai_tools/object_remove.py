"""Object removal start route.

This module starts object removal jobs that require both an uploaded source
image and an uploaded mask image. Job execution is delegated through the shared
dispatcher to keep route behavior consistent with the other AI tools.

Expected workflow:
    1. Client initializes an ``objectremove`` job.
    2. Client uploads the source image and mask image to Azure Blob Storage.
    3. Client calls this route with ``job_id``, ``safe_filename``, and
       ``mask_filename``.
    4. The backend reserves capacity and processes the job asynchronously.
