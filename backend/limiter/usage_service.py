"""Usage quota service for PixelForge features.

This service implements 24-hour feature usage accounting on top of
``UsageRepository``. Usage is tracked per ``client_ip:feature`` key so each AI
tool can have independent limits.

The service intentionally fails open for some database read failures to avoid
blocking all users during transient database issues. Write failures are logged
but do not interrupt already accepted processing.
