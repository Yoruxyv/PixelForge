"""In-process queue and concurrency guard for AI jobs.

This module tracks currently active jobs and prevents the backend process from
accepting more concurrent AI work than configured. It is intentionally simple
and process-local; if the backend is scaled horizontally, each process keeps its
own local queue state.
