"""Color restoration AI feature service.

This module implements the color-restoration feature using the shared image
pipeline. Its feature-specific responsibility is validating that the uploaded
image is effectively grayscale before sending it to the remote model.

After grayscale validation succeeds, preprocessing is delegated back to
``ImagePipelineService`` so color restoration receives the same shared input
safety as other normal AI tools:

    - uploaded byte-size validation,
    - uploaded resolution validation,
    - generic input downscaling before provider execution,
    - final generated-result size enforcement.
