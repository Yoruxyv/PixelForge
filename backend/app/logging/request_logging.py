"""HTTP request logging middleware.

This module logs one structured line per completed request, including client IP,
HTTP method, request path, response status code, and elapsed duration.

The middleware intentionally logs after ``call_next`` returns so the status code
and execution time reflect the actual response produced by downstream route
handlers.
